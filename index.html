			<h2>Vanderpump Rules</h2>
			<h5><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-time"></span> Post by Hunter, Mar 28, 2017.</h5>
			<p>Lisa Vanderpump first gained fame as a cast member on "The Real Housewives of Beverly Hills," but her full-time job is as co-owner and boss at West Hollywood, Calif., restaurant SUR, which stands for Sexy Unique Restaurant. Vanderpump balances her motherly instinct with her shrewd business sense to maintain control over the restaurant's wild group of employees who are working at the eatery while pursuing their dreams. Drama seems to be part of the job for the employees at SUR, who tend to date -- and, in most cases, subsequently break up with -- their fellow co-workers.</p>

			<h2>Jax Taylor</h2>
			<h5><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-time"></span> Post by Hunter, Sep 27, 2016.</h5>
			<p>Jax Taylor (born Jason Taylor in Shelby Township, Michigan on July 11, 1979) is a model/actor and reality star. He was once in the army, but moved to New York City as a youngster to pursue modeling; living with actor Channing Tatum in the process. He then moved to Miami and eventually Los Angeles, where he decided to change his name from Jason to Jax because there were already too many Jasons in the industry. He’s booked gigs with the likes of Taco Bell, Trump Magazine, GQ, Abercrombie and Fitch and JC Penny, and he was also the cover model for the popular video game Assassin’s Creed. He rose to fame in 2013, when The Real Housewives of Beverly Hills spinoff Vanderpump Rules featured Jax as SUR Restaurant’s sexy, often shirtless bartender. Jax became a breakout star on the show due to his womanizing ways and his on-and-off relationship with his co-star Stassi Schroeder.</p>
